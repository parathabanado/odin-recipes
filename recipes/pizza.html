        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to bake at 500 F.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, grab a ball of dough and begin to roll out the dough on top of a lightly floured countertop, beginning in the center and rolling outwards.</li>
        <li>Once rolled out, carefully place the dough on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Add a heavy spoonful of your red sauce to the center of the dough and begin spreading the sauce to the edges using circular movements with the backside of your spoon.</li>
        <li>Top with shaved pieces of low moisture mozzarella, then add pieces of the buffalo mozzarella with your hands.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on your oven, until the edges of the pizza are crispy.</li>
