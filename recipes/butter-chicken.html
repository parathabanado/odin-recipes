        <em>Steps</em>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <u>Marinating the Chicken:</u>
        <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric powder, chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade mixture, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably, overnight for the best flavor.</li>
    </ol>
    <u>Cooking the Butter Chicken:</u>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Allow it to melt and sizzle.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan, discarding any excess marinade. Cook the chicken until it's fully cooked and has a nice golden color. This should take about 7-10 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent and lightly browned, which should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ginger paste and garlic paste to the onions, and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato puree and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing it to thicken and the oil to separate from the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the garam masala, paprika (or Kashmiri chili powder), turmeric, cumin, and coriander powders. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid burning the spices.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and slowly pour in the heavy cream, stirring continuously to combine it with the tomato and spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked chicken pieces to the pan and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken to your desired consistency. Add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Once the Butter Chicken is ready, garnish it with fresh cilantro leaves if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice or naan bread. Enjoy your homemade Butter Chicken!</li>
